LegalLens - Legal Document Assistant (HenHacks 2025)

Overview

The LegalLens web application is designed to help users navigate long and complex legal documents. Instead of simply summarizing the content, our tool categorizes the document into different sections based on significance, making it easier to identify critical information, and assess potential risks.

Features

📂 Categorization of Document Content

The app intelligently processes the legal document and categorizes information into three key sections:

Common and Typical Information – Standard legal clauses and general terms that do not require special attention.

Important Information Requiring Attention – Sections that contain unusual clauses, impactful terms, or potential risks (e.g., uncommon conditions, financial implications, potential scams).

Fields to Be Filled Out – Sections requiring user input, such as signature fields, dates, or personal details.

🔍 Interactive Document Exploration

Each categorized section is represented by one-line clickable titles.

Clicking on a title expands to show either a summary of the section or the full details, allowing users to choose the depth of information they need.

✍️ Guided Form Filling

Includes a Help Button for each field, linking users to the relevant section’s description (either common or important).

🔎 Document Risk Assessment

Generates a safety rating for the document based on:

The content of the document itself.

Statistical analysis of previous users’ interactions and concerns.

Displays aggregated statistics to show how others have interacted with similar documents.
